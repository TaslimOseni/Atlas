		<p class="bio_text">I am Taslim Oseni and I love having fun. My major childhood hobbies were playing rough, asking too many questions and solving riddles. This soon translated into a strong desire to build software as I grew older. Life becomes more interesting when we never let our inner-child die; that way, we never lose touch of creativity.</p>
